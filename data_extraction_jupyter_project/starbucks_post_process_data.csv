Manager: ""can't your wife take your kid to the doctor?"" 

Me: 'no that's not an option, I requested this 3 months in advance so you would have plenty of time to figure out the schedule"" 

Manager:  ""I want you to reschedule the doctors appointment or find someone else to take your kid to the doctor""

Me: You can approve the request or I can hand you my keys right now.

Manager: I'm not approving that, I need you to open that day.

Me: Writes a note that says ""I quit effective immediately because {SMs name} can't figure out a schedule with 3 months notice"", hands over my keys, clocks out and leaves",colonade17,starbucks,2023-08-22,12:47:54

He just likes to wear it. We are in a fairly conservative area with a lot of really nice people who might not like seeing people wear a mask but don't typically act like a Karen, he usually just gets a few odd looks or innocent questions from concerned people who don't understand a mask doesn't equate to you being sick. Just kind of goes with the territory...

But today we had a Karen customer. She was ranting to me at the register about the barista on bar wearing a mask, how masks don't block or protect you from covid, they deprive you of precious oxygen and make you breathe in your own exhaled waste, wearing one just makes you a fascist sheep, blah blah blah.

I let her do her whole spiel, then bent down behind the register and put on my own mask. And she flipped out. She started cursing up a storm and making a scene for everyone nearby to see. Someone even filmed it so who knows maybe it'll appear on YouTube or tiktok.

When she asked me why I was now wearing a mask I simply told her it was a symbol of solidarity to support healthcare professionals. c:

I think I made her blood boil.

She did not take her drink she had already paid for. She left in a furious rage. Now an hour later that drink is still on the handoff counter.

Can I please get a ""I survived Karen"" pin for my apron now? :c",InvincibleSugar,starbucks,2023-07-16,19:15:38

His disgusted face got even worse and he literally faked throwing up and gagging because of it. like.. why does it matter to you what I do? I'm not harming anybody with it. I don't want to talk beliefs from customers at work, especially if they're about wearing a piece of cloth over my face

I personally wear one because I have anxiety and I don't like people seeing my face. Plus, I see so many people at work that I don't know who is or isn't sick, or who is immunocompromised or not. I don't want to put them in harms way as much as I can.

There had to be at least 15 items of that list.

I stood there waiting in line with my little boy in my arms for a minute or so, when a barista approached me and asked if he could get something started for me. I ordered a sweet cream cold brew and he made it right away and brought it around and handed it to me. He told me I didn‚Äôt owe anything, that I deserved it because I‚Äôm doing a great job. I don‚Äôt know this guy, have never met him or seen him. I‚Äôm not a regular at this particular location. And he was so, so kind.

They removed the covid food and drink benefits, they removed the ability to work under 12 hours, they removed the covid isolation policy.

This is another reminder, unionizing protects you and your coworkers from losing your benefits. It gives you a chance to renegotiate your contract with laws protecting it from getting worse. Starbucks will lie, gaslight, and fight hard to make sure you don't understand your rights or the benifits of collectively working together

Edit: by covid food and drink markout I'm referring to the benifit where we received our daily markouts even if you didn't work

Edit2: spelling and correction of hours

I am a long-long-longtime customer of Starbucks.  I pick up coffee every morning on my way to work.  At this point, I haven‚Äôt missed a day in over two years.  Sometimes I use the drive thru, but mostly I place my order on the app and run inside to pick it up. 

What I am met with, each and every day from the baristas is a smile and a warm hello.  Yes, I‚Äôm a regular, so they all know me at this point.  But I see them do it to everyone.  Whether or not you‚Äôre asked by management to do this is beside the point.  It‚Äôs genuine, and I can tell.  

To all baristas:  Thank you.  I‚Äôm convinced you don‚Äôt hear that enough. 

Morning is an interesting time of day.  When you see your customers, their day has either gotten off to a good start, or a bad one.  Too often you‚Äôre on the front lines of someone fighting a bad day.  They make you the face of their problems and lash out, nearly always, for no reason.  I‚Äôve seen it happen. 

I can‚Äôt think of a place that requires multitasking more than Starbucks.  I watch you.  I‚Äôm in awe of you, honestly.  You are taking endless orders, all customized, while handling cash transactions and listening to gripes from customers.  And the Karens.  There are so many Karens. 

The teamwork you display on a minute-to-minute basis is inspiring.  As a hiring manager of my own firm, seeing Starbucks Barista on a resume will always get my attention.  You are such a talented and hardworking group.  You may argue that there are exceptions, and surely, anytime you employ as many as you do, there will be exceptions.  But they are so few and far between.  They are not who I‚Äôm talking to.  I‚Äôm talking to YOU.  Thank YOU. 

Your coffee literally makes my day better.  Even when there‚Äôs not enough cream.  Or too much cream.  Or it‚Äôs not hot enough.  Whatever.  It‚Äôs coffee.  The world will not begin or end with my coffee.

But I know my day will begin with a smile from my barista.  And for that, I am grateful.",Upper-Dot9517,starbucks,2022-08-31,18:28:54

There were no drive-throughs and our food started and ended with pastries. It was a coffeeshop, a ""Third Place."" Congenial, friendly, intimate, fun. 

I left for a long time. During this time Howard Schulz stepped down and McCafe started. Starbucks felt threatened by this cheaper, industrial, no-personality option. The smell of food began to overwhelm the smell of espresso, the drive-through began to overwhelm the caf√©, the mobile orders came, and the look and feel of the fun beatnik hangout spot turned into a corporate industry frantically running against time. The look of happiness on the barista's faces was replaced by a grim and overwhelmed blankness.

The coffees, too, disappeared. Arabian Mocha Java, Sulaweisi, Kenya, Sanani, New Guinea Peaberry... the interesting and fun variety subsumed into the bland and mediocre Pike Place and a few others to adapt to a market Starbucks was never meant to cater to. 

Starbucks is at a loss trying to figure out how to improve connection scores and the Third Place feel. Well, that's really dumb. They know what the problem is; they have to. It's not just me that said this stuff, Howard Schulz said it himself repeatedly. It's no secret. 

If you want to be a Third Place, it can't be industrial. If you want it to be industrial, it can't be a Third Place.  Get rid of the drive through, get rid of the fast food. If you wanna be McDonald's, don't be shocked when you lose the soul.

Unionizing your store: A how to guide,4620,s4zw6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/s4zw6m/unionizing_your_store_a_how_to_guide/,358,2022-01-16 01:25:02,"Hey everyone! 

I‚Äôve been on this subreddit for a while and it seems like every day now we‚Äôre getting 3 types of posts. 1) New store unionizing!! 2) Peeps asking about unionizing and how to begin. Or 3) comments on horror stories telling the op to unionize.

I‚Äôm an organizer at one of the newer stores to have filed to unionize, and I want to share with you the very broad strokes of how we got the ball rolling. The whole idea seemed so nebulous and scary at first, but once you have your partners on board, it‚Äôs actually surprisingly easy to start. I hope that sharing my experience will make the whole thing less intimidating.

Also: you may have your opinions on whether or not Unionizing is right for you. This post isn‚Äôt really about that conversation. This is just to help people who DO want to unionize figure out where to start. Please be nice.

**Step one: Reach out.**

No seriously. If you are even thinking about wanting to unionize, reach out to Starbucks Workers United. They‚Äôre on twitter u/SBWorkersUnited and you can even email sbworkersunited@gmail.com to get some advice at any stage. Likely there‚Äôs a store close to you that‚Äôs already organizing that they can put you in contact with. I‚Äôve spoken with partners from four stores in the past couple of months and helped to answer questions and I know other stores are doing the same.

SWU also has materials that are very useful tools. They have stuff for talking points with partners who may be on the fence. They have insights into tactics that corporate is using to bust the unions. They have a lot of very helpful and empowering information that they are more than willing to give to you.

**Step two: Talk to your partners.**

This step is really the most important step. The rest is just paperwork. The whole point of a union is to band together with your coworkers to negotiate to make your workplace better. Start with one person you trust and agrees with you and build from there. I was really lucky with my store and everyone was basically just waiting for someone to hand them a union card. Once I realized that, I sent an email. I know everyone‚Äôs stores can be different. Some people are aggressively anti-union and some people might simply not see the point. It really depends on your situation as to what you should do here.

I recommend getting 3 or 4 of your partners at least who are willing to help you organize. At my store, the 4 of us just shared a group text message where we discussed everything. This helps spread the workload around so no one gets overwhelmed ‚Äì or when someone does, they can pull back and rely on the others to fill in. Try to get a person who represents each day part as well. At the stores we‚Äôve been talking to, a lot of the night crew is hella on board already probably because managers are rarely there, so they have more unsupervised time to talk about things.

BE CAREFUL. At this stage you‚Äôre vulnerable so you‚Äôll have to be strategic. Have a narc for a ssv? Try talking to your baristas after you get off or outside of work. Ssv‚Äôs on your side but your SM is a devil? Talk to each other on the weekends when they‚Äôre not there. It‚Äôs a bit easier to bring up unions now. I asked a lot of ‚Äúwhat do you think about what happened in Buffalo?‚Äù to gauge the level of interest.

And of course, if you ever feel like you don‚Äôt know what to do next, circle back to step one. There are a lot of us who are invested in helping each other. Whether that‚Äôs a zoom call, a text, or a ‚Äúyou can do it!‚Äù

Once you have most of your store on board, continue to step three.

**Step Three:** **Seriously, contact Starbucks Workers United.**

I‚Äôm listing this as a step three because this was actually my step two. (Whoops). I waited until literally my whole store was ready before I ever reached out. So, if you‚Äôre like me and have skipped step one, this is when you‚Äôll 100% have to reach out. SWU will provide you with materials you may be missing and walk you through the next few steps.

**Step Four: Gather signatures.**

Workers United will send you the pdf to the cards to hand to your coworkers. Technically you only need \~30% of your store to sign to file. But I'd recommend getting as many people as you can to sign. Starbucks will launch a huge anti-union campaign once you file and you want as many people aware of what‚Äôs going as possible. A big part of union busting is to create division on your team, so you‚Äôll want as many people on your side as possible.

**Step Five: Create a group chat.**

You may notice a common theme here, and it‚Äôs communicating to your partners. A LOT. Lol. At this point my store created a group chat with everyone who‚Äôd signed cards. This way we‚Äôd be able to share everything with everyone as soon as we knew. The closer we are, the harder it is to divide us.

Step Six: Write your letters and file.

You‚Äôll have to write your petition to the NLRB and a letter to Kevin Johnson. You‚Äôll also have to scan your cards and submit the actual documents to the NLRB. It‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt know wtf to do. We asked a million questions over and over throughout this process. I‚Äôm still not entirely sure if my partner emailed Kevin Johnson directly or went through Workers United. *I guess the point I‚Äôm trying to make is that these steps can sound intimidating, but you‚Äôll have people holding your hand through the whole thing if you need it.*

**Aftermath:**

Yay you‚Äôve filed!! Now what? You‚Äôll let the world know you‚Äôve filed. You now have legal protection as well as the protection of public opinion. If Starbucks does something dodgy, you have ways to hold them accountable.

At work there‚Äôll be a whole lot of nothing for a few days except a grumpy store manager. But then expect visits from DM‚Äôs and Regional Directors asking how they can support you (technically illegal after filing but whatever). You‚Äôll get emails from them as well as new signs in the back. Take pictures of everything. I literally send everything they post to our lawyer. Outside of work, you‚Äôll likely have hella interviews with local news stations because this is a big deal. *Again, don‚Äôt be too freaked out by this.* You‚Äôll be walked through some media training. And if interviews aren‚Äôt really your thing, find someone who‚Äôs comfortable with it. Make it fun! The whole point of a Union is to have a team of coworkers on your side.

That‚Äôs all I have right now. But I know from being online and seeing what they‚Äôve done in Buffalo that we have tons of captive audience meetings and stuff ahead of us. It‚Äôll be annoying but knowing there is an end to this makes it a bit easier. My tip to you is to prepare your people for what they‚Äôre getting into from the jump. The more you know going in, the less likely you'll be caught off guard when the bs starts. I will say that the more stores that file (and there are so so many coming soon) the harder it will be for corporate to launch full scale attacks like in Buffalo. Things may very well get easier as more of us move to unionize. There‚Äôs more of us than there are of them. And that‚Äôs what scares corporate so much.

I know work has been hell for a lot of us recently. I know unions are a controversial topic. But if you‚Äôll indulge my soapbox moment, I think that we are living through a time that could completely change how our labor is valued. It‚Äôs bigger than your single store, it‚Äôs bigger than this company.

This is the most excited I‚Äôve felt about working at Starbucks in over half a decade and it‚Äôs because the people I work with are coming together and fighting for each other.

Annnnnyway. I‚Äôll get down off this soapbox. Hopefully this was educational. Hopefully this made the whole process seem less scary. Hopefully it inspired a few of you to start the process at your stores. Maybe you just found it interesting.

If you need any more info or contact information, feel free to DM me! I‚Äôll do my best to respond to you all.

""No ma'am, we don't have anything like that.""

Sure enough, she had a photo where someone had filled up a cup with some sort of blue liquid and stuffed a bunch of gummi worms in it.

""Okay but ma'am, I'm still telling you that that's not a thing."" And then I walked away before she could keep arguing with me. 

She then goes up to register and asks for it anyway, explaining to the green bean I have there what it is and how much her daughter wants it. Green bean says she's never heard of it, but she's still new, so wait one second while she grabs her supervisor...which is ME.

Can I refuse to hand out a drink to a regular customer that routinely tries to scam us in the mornings?,2433,rpn70b,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/rpn70b/can_i_refuse_to_hand_out_a_drink_to_a_regular/,220,2021-12-27 13:08:38,"Title says it all BUT for a little background so you guys know I‚Äôm not just trying to be a cunt...

Lady comes through our drive thru every morning to get a venti hot chai latte with ‚Äúno water‚Äù being her only modification. Our store is very drive thru heavy (being that it‚Äôs along a busy highway going into NYC) in the morning so the playcallers always put our best baristas on DT bar. When they‚Äôre there, yknow you‚Äôre gonna get good quality drinks.

So the customer will get her drink, take a sip, then start calling us inept because she ‚Äútastes water‚Äù. We‚Äôll put on the customer service act and offer to remake it, and this can go on until she gets 2 more free chai lattes, insults us more, and then drives off. This whole ordeal happens almost every morning and always hurts our DT times by at least 5 min. Our SM is a real jerk (you can see my post history) and refuses to do anything about her. When I‚Äôve offered to take back some of her ‚Äúbad drinks‚Äù, she refuses.

So my question is, can I just straight up refuse to serve her offer and not remake her drink to save the stress from my other coworkers?",newcleargandhi,starbucks,2021-12-27,13:08:38

Found out a regular is a Scrooge,1680,rel3bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/rel3bh/found_out_a_regular_is_a_scrooge/,85,2021-12-12 08:57:57,"So I worked for 6 Christmases at Bux, and every year, there was a woman (let‚Äôs call her Karen) who owned some company and she would come in to buy ~400 gift cards, give or take, for all her employees. Sometimes it was her, sometimes her assistant in her stead. Nothing extravagant: they were $5 each for junior employees and $10 for senior, and she‚Äôd give upwards of $30 to her higher level directors and whatnot. Was this in lieu of a Christmas bonus? No way of knowing for sure. All I knew was that Karen had chosen me to be the person who had to handle the transaction on whatever day she waltzed in to make her ~$4500 gift card purchase. She asked for me by name if I wasn‚Äôt already on the floor, and actually followed me to my new stores when I transferred to make sure it was me who did it. I still don‚Äôt know why - maybe I did such a mind-blowing job my first year that I got in her good graces? I got good and fast at it in my later years, but even at the height of my powers it still took at least 20 minutes to power through all those suckers because Karen refused to buy the multipacks. She said she didn‚Äôt trust them. (That‚Äôs a fun moment of irony for later in this story.) She also refused to buy bulk gift cards online, when that option became available, for the same reason. It had to be in person, individual gift cards, 400 of them, all at once. I had to split up the transactions because the POS wouldn‚Äôt let you charge more than $2k on one transaction. The same routine every year, without fail. Her receipts were epic. I wore them as scarves.

Well, her company is local, and her employees often came in, too. I don‚Äôt work for Starbucks anymore, but I guess she hit up the store a little earlier than usual this year, and her employees already had their gift cards as of last week. Two of them came in together and tried to use their gift cards with my former coworker. Neither card was loaded with anything, even though they‚Äôd just gotten them recently. One employee turned to the other, rolling their eyes, and said ‚ÄúWhat a shocker. Have you ever gotten one that worked?‚Äù The other guy scoffed and said no, that it was year four and he had yet to get a working one. They paid like normal and walked away.

Today my same coworker was on reg again, and one of those same employees came in again and recognized her. He said they found out what happened with their gift cards, and he was, like, vibrating with glee telling my coworker about it: Apparently Karen did, in fact, hand out Starbucks cards in lieu of bonuses. But the gift cards never worked, and finally this year someone with enough clout got annoyed enough about it that they went to Karen to find out what the deal was with the fucking things. Turns out, after her spree every year, Karen would tell her credit card company that her card had been stolen, and those $2k charges would get blocked, meaning every single gift card she bought was rendered inert. All to avoid spending any extra money at all on her employees at Christmas. Her assistant apparently confessed to the whole scheme, and now her board is pressuring her into granting Christmas bonuses for everyone in the company because they all threatened to quit. Possibly including the board, it was unclear from the, like, fourth hand story my coworker told me.

I can‚Äôt make this shit up, y‚Äôall. Even after leaving, some customers continue to amaze me with their commitment to scumbaggery. I hope all her employees quit and then sue her.",untilcomplete,starbucks,2021-12-12,08:57:57

I was the closing shift supervisor tonight and I came in to a mess. This is pretty consistent for Sundays. My SM never schedules enough people on Sundays. 
We did get her to turn Mobiles off, but we had lines to order in the cafe pretty consistently. 
We couldn‚Äôt keep up with backups/dishes. Trash was overflowing everywhere. 
Customers were mad because we are out of mocha, Caramel Br√ªl√©e, iced Sugar Cookie syrups. Oh and no straws. 
Partners were having panic attacks. 

One partner became so stressed they threw up (in the bathroom). 
And had to go home. 
I asked to close the lobby. 
Because food count still needed to be done. Pastry pull needed to be done. The partner that left at 7 needed her break. The DT partner needed her meal. I would need a meal. There was cold brew that needed to be pulled at 3 just sitting there. We needed to make 4 toddies of cold brew. 
Oh and ALL of the closing stuff that hadn‚Äôt even been started. 

The SM said no. The DM doesn‚Äôt want the lobby closed if there are 3 partners in the floor. 
But with people on their meals and me doing shift stuff there wouldn‚Äôt be. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I got written up a week and a half ago and one of the things on there was ‚Äúbreaking federal labor laws by keeping partners past 9pm‚Äù.
But how am I supposed to get them out on time??? 

Oh and there is no federal labor law that I was breaking. 

Anyway the SM called the store and said ‚ÄúDo NOT close the lobby‚Äù.
I said ‚Äúif we can‚Äôt close the lobby then you need to come close, because there is to much stuff to do. ‚Äú
She said:
‚ÄúWe are not having this conversation over the phone. I am on my way and when I get there you will leave‚Äù
Then she hung up.

Well if she wanted me to leave, I was going to leave. 
I went to the back and got my stuff. 
Took my keys and set them on the counter and told the Partners that those are for SM. Then I left.

It felt so good!

what the fuck are they thinking?

are they so confident in their greed to think that the situation in buffalo is going to stay isolated?

my store is closing at 130pm today instead of 8pm because we are so understaffed we have no coverage if a shift lead gets sick. 

yesterday, 2 stores within 15 minutes of my location closed early and multiple drive thru locations were operating on 2 person plays. 3 stores within 15 minutes of my location turned off mobile ordering. due to this, all business diverged to my location which already had a line out the door in a cafe and delivery store at 6am. 

there were 3 of us!!!!!

needless to say we also turned off mobile and delivery orders. 

how long do they think they can kick the can down this road?

what the hell is it going to take for them to actually TREAT US LIKE PARTNERS

what are we going to do about this, y‚Äôall? there are A LOT of us. please start having conversations about this with the people you work with. corporate clearly does not plan on hearing us when we say WE DO NOT GET PAID ENOUGH FOR RENT!!!!!!!!

traditional labor union or not, we have to do something about this. keep having the conversation!! don‚Äôt roll over and just take this anymore. 

they wanna brag about all their benefits, but wouldn‚Äôt a fanfuckintastic benefit be the ability to pay rent without it costing over half of your income per month?

(A couple fellow SSVs disagreed and said if someone throws up for any reason, you can't come to work for 24 hours. I'm pretty sure that's the law or an OSHA rule but I couldn't find it anywhere. I didn't look that hard though.)

A couple hours into my shift I threw up again and was in so much pain I could barely stand. We were also down a person; leaving a two-partner play from 6-9. My coworker asked my SM if we could close early and she laughed. Turning off MOP was the best she could do. I tried to endure the pain but I couldn't. I texted my boss apologizing and saying we need to close early if nobody can cover me; I physically can't do this. She called me to yell at me: ""Domotastic. YOU ARE NOT SICK. YOU CAN WORK. YOU'RE FINE.""

I'd had enough. I talked to my coworkers about walking out; they all gave me their full support. I hugged them all, grabbed my tips, gave a barista my shift and store keys, texted my SM that I was walking out and didn't look back.

I've been getting calls from our district and regional managers expressing how ""sorry they are about our tragic loss"" and it's so blatantly obvious that they don't actually care and are just trying to save face. Our store was still open for a couple **hours** after it happened. And even after we posted the signs on our doors saying ""WE'RE CLOSED"", having to sit in that store and watching all the customers trying to open our doors and banging on the windows...

Our district manager was in the store at the time talking to my store manager. They called the police down to take a report (the cops thought it was great and couldn‚Äôt stop laughing). I pointed out that we work hard for tips and they won‚Äôt reimburse us when they‚Äôre stolen. Management did not find my explanation satisfactory and I was fired the next week. Thus, my 3 year stint with the ‚ÄòBucks came to an unceremonious end. It was well worth it. Fuck ‚Äòem.",PossiblyUnhinged,starbucks,2021-09-15,17:03:32

Recently, with fall launch, we‚Äôve had lines around the building and only three partners at most on nights. My manager refused to schedule more partners and left us to drown. It was 4 hours into the shift, the line had only built. Our window average was up to about 5:00 minutes, and she refused to let us close down cafe or mobile orders. I walked out. She has made it clear that she only cares about morning shift and refuses to help night shift whatsoever. People on morning shift have at least 7 partner plays during peak times. They were measured and made my manager look good, so she only helped morning crew. Left us to drown.

I was on Window/DTO/Bar 2 when I finally decided I had had enough. I simply sat my headset down, clocked out and left. My manager chewed me out over the phone and blocked my number.

Stop making people feel bad for wanting anything more complex than a latte, or for asking a question you think is stupid or the answer should be obvious. 

Blame our god-awful experiences on management and the real Karens who set out to make our lives miserable. Most people are pretty reasonable and just want a cup of coffee. Feel free use reddit as a safe space to rant (god knows I do) or to inform customers who do want to know what it's like on our side, but little nitpicks like ""don't order frappucinos"" or ""be sure to order exactly this way otherwise you're annoying"" need to stop.

Let people order however and (pretty much) whatever they want. As long as everyone is kind to each other there should be no issues.

I moonlight as a bartender. There‚Äôs a reason why James Bond always gets his vodka martini shaken instead of stirred. Because it changes the taste!!

_Your drink becomes chilled more quickly and evenly. Secondly, the drink becomes aerated, which means bubbles, which means texture.

Kind of tricky to get right the first time but once you got it you'll never want to go back

Say hello to your baristas, look them in the eyes, and dont treat them as if they are either soulless serving machines or utter morons. If you are feeling a little extra crazy try saying the drink size first before stating your order, but that one is completely up to you. And then in the end, maybe say thank you when you get handed your order. Boom

No but seriously I beg of you, the bar is on the floor. If i get one more dumb snarky comment about something by a 40 year old woman, that cant seem to be bothered treating me like an actual person I am going to lose my shit and start throwing frappuchinos",NeoFaber,starbucks,2021-08-03,20:40:46

I proceeded to crudely cut off the company logo off my shirt, struggling bc they obviously weren't fabric scissors, but I got the job done. I crumpled the polyester logo in one hand, gave back the scissors, and askes ""Am I punk now?""

ATTENTION PARTNERS: CUSTOMER MASK MANDATE ENDS MONDAY. WE NEED TO ACT FAST TO SHOW THE COMPANY THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND I HAVE CREATED THIS THREAD SO WE CAN DISCUSS OUR NEXT STEPS,2540,ncx4py,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/ncx4py/attention_partners_customer_mask_mandate_ends/,590,2021-05-15 11:51:23,"**EDIT: A [petition](http://chng.it/dzsQY7Yb64) is now available.  Sign it and let your voice be heard!**

It is unacceptable that less than 50% of Americans are not fully vaccinated and Starbucks is ending the mask requirement.  WE ARE NOT READY.  *[Redacted an incorrect statement about plexis here]*  There are 36% of Americans vaccinated as I type this.

What can we do to act quickly and tell the company this is not okay?  We are sitting ducks.  Think of it like this: almost every 1 in 4 customers you interact with will NOT be vaccinated and will NOT be wearing anything to protect you or your families.

**Since this is blowing up here's a few clarifying things:**

1) Customers are not required to wear a mask **unless it is still mandated by local authorities**

2) Partners are still required to wear a mask due to OSHA regulations

3) The human head weighs an average of 8 pounds

**EDIT 2**

Folks, I believe the science.  But I also believe the statistics.  Where I live, the majority of citizens are Trump supporters who will NOT get vaccinated.  The vaccination is effective but it isn't full proof.  The CDC says ""vaccinated people can go without masks"", not EVERYBODY.   We are not following the science with this decision as a company.",Reflective_Larry,starbucks,2021-05-15,11:51:23

I am removing particular details to maintain my identity. 


Hi Kevin. My name is..., and I managed the Starbucks in.... I've put in my two weeks, but I'm amazed at the outrage and honesty that's being demonstrated in the message that has your name attached to it in Store Communications. 

I have no intentions on continuing my career with Starbucks, so perhaps that gives me the courage to finally speak up. 

I am amazed at the consistent disconnect between management and store level partners. 

I believed in Starbucks. Past tense. It‚Äôs been a few years since I believed that this was about coffee, or even our mission and values.

I admire that we consistently live up to our shareholder‚Äôs expectations.

I am often impressed by the dividends that we pay out. 

I would like to see Starbucks continue to thrive as a company.

However, I have had the impression for quite some time that we, as a company, are not aware of the workloads that we place upon our store level partners, and how the pay is not representative of the physical or emotional tolls that working with the general public places upon us.

I am consistently amazed at the lack of feedback that we seek out. Coaching upward was a phrase we used when I began with Starbucks six years ago. However, we seem to only demand downward now.

I wonder if you are aware of the general attitude of your store managers in the mid-Atlantic region, that we are overworked, and the requirements of the position to succeed.

I also wonder if you are aware of the general sentiments of our shift supervisor and barista teams in the mid-Atlantic region.

I of course can‚Äôt speak to the status entire company, however if you were to take anonymous surveys of the store level partners in this region, you may be surprised at the dissatisfied responses (or, perhaps, worse, you wouldn‚Äôt be surprised).

I also know that statistical anomalies are statistical anomalies because they do not occur often. 

We are most likely not unique. 

We are underpaying our shift supervisors for what we expect of them. Many of them can get jobs that pay better with significantly less responsibility.

While our benefits package is absolutely fantastic, the low pay fails to acknowledge that many hourly partners struggle to pay rent or put food on their table.

When programs like Lyra and Headspace roll out, it‚Äôs infuriating. You are acknowledging the issues that we face while failing to acknowledge why these issues arise in so many.

You are curing the symptoms without diagnosing the disease.

Giving someone pain killers to cure the migraines caused by cancer does not fix the cancer. 

Please stop with the platitudes and begin addressing us as the intelligent human beings that we are. You cannot create a company culture with the propaganda. 

It begins with the top.

We as a company do not live up to our Mission and Values anymore. 

We fail to challenge our status quo; we are not connecting with our store level partners with transparency, and when you fail at transparency you fail at dignity or respect.

Everything that is coming out of Seattle is presented as disingenuous and disconnected to hourly partners.

Without them, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to collect your paycheck or stock options.

Please reconsider how you‚Äôre connecting with us.

If we are heard, acknowledged, and our conditions were improved, you might find that our productivity would increase significantly.

I challenge you to challenge the status quo.

I challenge you to connect transparently, respectfully, and with dignity.

I challenge you to hold yourself accountable for the results of our current decisions.

I challenge you to create the culture we had, of warmth and belonging.

I challenge you to inspire the spirit of your partners again.

Thank you for your time,

Me

Edit: I was on the fence when I posted this about requesting people to share it. 

If you know anyone who would benefit from this, please share, partner or not. 

If we present a happy face to the public, they do not know the struggles we face on a daily basis. 

They don‚Äôt understand why drive thru times are high. 

They do not understand why they are waiting for their latte. 

If we do not speak up, management will never know what it is that we are facing on a daily basis. 

We stand stronger together. 

Have a lovely day everyone, and for those of you who share my sentiment, I hope things improve for you.

Edit 2: I‚Äôm realizing now that customers are coming here as well. I‚Äôd like to share the [Partner Promise that was shared by Kevin Johnson on our PartnerHub. I‚Äôm glad someone else shared it. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/i2uktd/no_hazard_pay_but_we_get_this_partner_promise/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

The reception from partners thus far has been almost entirely negative.

Edit 3: It‚Äôs been so fantastic to hear from so many of you the unique and varied experiences this company is facing. It also breaks my heart that so many of us feel this way with so little recourse. I need to call it a night, but I‚Äôll be sure to respond to everyone I‚Äôve missed tomorrow. Please be safe everyone, and take of yourselves. Physically and mentally. We stand stronger together.",IGoToADifferentSchoo,starbucks,2020-08-08,12:34:01

2. please don‚Äôt shove your card in my face over the plexi while i‚Äôm trying to take your order and roll your eyes and snap every time i ask a question to confirm.

3. you were not harassed at our store because a 14 year old barista spilled a bit of your drink as she was putting the lid on it. you did not have to say ‚Äúwell i‚Äôm a cop so i figured you wouldn‚Äôt even bother‚Äù when she apologized and got you a new lid.

4. keep your cross and heart mask on. why did you take it down to tell us you would never even come here but you had a gift card?

5. the young barista who‚Äôs name you demanded looked at you because you were making a scene at our pick up station. she did not harass you.

6. did you, a 40-something year old woman, really feel so threatened by two teenage baristas working their minimum wage jobs that you felt the need to call our shift manager, our store manager, and our district manager to complain on her ‚Äúdisrespectful behavior‚Äù and try to get her fired?

7. don‚Äôt come back. i remember you. i remember your name. i remember your face and that stupid mask you wore for 30 seconds of your trip. i remember how you made my partners break down in the back room because they felt utterly defeated since you decided to take out your frustrations on two minors working at a starbucks.

8. you are supposed to be our protection in this city, not the one to harass us over a caramel macchiato. it is because of people like YOU that cops have a bad name. you didn‚Äôt assert your power, you looked like a whiny two year old that didn‚Äôt get her way.",toocuteforthisshit,starbucks,2020-08-08,05:00:37

STARBUCKS DONT CARE IF YOU GOT COVID,1821,hsmjp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/hsmjp5/starbucks_dont_care_if_you_got_covid/,127,2020-07-17 01:18:18,"Hey, Im a very angry shift supervisor who cant breathe anymore. I work in a store with 5 highly at risk partners. (Heart transplant, severe asthma and lung disorder respectively)

Quick intro to the situation at my store:

A morning partner said she had 1 secondary symptom of covid about 3 weeks ago. So, our store sent her and 10 other morning people (including 3 shifts that are useless idiots anyways) 
on a paid 14 vacation. Store hours changed. My job got alot harder.

She didnt test positive and no morning person even got tested because why would they be cautious.

I had been working 6 day weeks since and coming in during mids and closing the store with my closing partners. I have contact with 70% of the people in my store because of covered shifts. In my most recent week I worked with every single barista we have. We do our best and I monitor how my partners are feeling almost religiously. Sunday, at 5pm during a close my father tests positive. He took his test a week prior and we live together. I hadnt shown symptoms at all. Oh shit right? Wrong.

They send just me home and then the next day I test positive. What do they do? They tell me I dont have symptoms and therefore the store isnt closing and only 2 partners I worked with go home. The store doesnt even know that I tested positive until I stir shit up in the group chat. My friends, my coworkers are terrified that I gave it to them. My district manager ignores them. My fellow idiot shifts tell them not to panic. I JUST WANT THEM TO GO GET TESTED AND THE CUSTOMERS DONT EVEN KNOW THAT THE ENTIRE NIGHT SHIFT PROBABLY HAS COVID BECAUSE OF ME

Starbucks doesnt care if you have covid. They care about when you tell them you sneezed. People are going to drop like flies soon. The baristas at risk are still in that store now, and 3 have them have cried at work today.",Nitr0Cold,starbucks,2020-07-17,01:18:18

Public service announcement for customers ordering with light/no ice.,2045,gjm9ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/gjm9ql/public_service_announcement_for_customers/,299,2020-05-14 13:24:20,"I wanted to mention this simply because I don't think a lot of customers understand. If I sound condescending at all, believe me, it's not intentional. I'm trying to help. 

I know a huge trend right now is to get drinks with light or no ice, maybe a cup of ice on the side (partly fueled by TikTok hack videos and the like). Sure, you get more for your money. And I know this bothers a lot of baristas. It annoys me a little, but I'm on the side of, ""It's not my money, and Starbucks wouldn't let it happen if they weren't still making profit.""

There's one problem that I think a lot of customers aren't aware of and that's our handcrafted recipes. To elaborate (and this is where I'm afraid I'll sound condescending but don't mean to be), every Starbucks drink is made to standard by a certain specific recipe. There's a certain number of shots or pumps of this or scoops of that. I feel like some people think we just open a spout and the iced caramel macchiato comes pouring out and if you ask for less ice, you get more caramel macchiato. 

The truth is if you take something away, we have to add something else to fill the space. A lot of times this is just extra milk, which can change the taste of the drink because it's more ""watered down."" For example, if you order an iced venti chai, light ice, there's still only six pumps of chai. We're just pouring in more milk. If do the same with a caramel macchiato, we don't automatically add more vanilla or espresso. 

My point is that if you're asking for light/no ice because you want more drink, but you don't ask for extra ingredients, the drink will taste different and that can lead to a sad experience. This isn't so much a problem with teas or refreshers but a lot of other drinks are affected. Unfortunately, if it's another shot of espresso, you gotta pay. But if it's other stuff, most of it's free. If you want an iced venti chai, light ice, try asking for 7-8 pumps of chai instead of 6. We're not allowed to just assume that's what you're going for (maybe some people do want a less strong flavor). If it's the caramel macchiato, maybe another shot and an extra pump of vanilla. 

I just feel like this happens a lot but people really don't understand the process and I just want people to be happy with their drinks.

Edit for clarification: I'm aware people get light/no ice for other reasons and I didn't mean to imply everyone's a cheapskate, but I think most baristas would err on the side of filling the cup. If you'd rather not alter the recipe/flavor, feel free to let us know you'd like light/no ice but you don't want anything added and you're okay with a little room in the cup. That should speed things up.",thedeadwillwalk,starbucks,2020-05-14,13:24:20

A customers perspective,2094,9ttmj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/9ttmj7/a_customers_perspective/,148,2018-11-03 12:16:25,"Went into Starbucks on red cup day without even realizing it was red cup day. Didn't understand why it was so crazy and everyone seemed in a terrible mood. I waited in line and heard people walking out saying ""never coming back here"" and ""fuck this place"" so I figure maybe the kid at the counter was a dick. Nope nice guy. Feaferfully informed me there were bones cups

""Oh that's today? Indidnteven known that. Nah I just want black coffee I don't care about the cup""

It's a $2 piece of shit plastic. I can understand people acting this was if it was, say a holiday ceramic mug, but not a $2 piece of plastic that you're gonna throw away tomorow.

All you Starbucks employees are under appreciated. Good luck out there during this holiday season ",bromygod203,starbucks,2018-11-03,12:16:25
