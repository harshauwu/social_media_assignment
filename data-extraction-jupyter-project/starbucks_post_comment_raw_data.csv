That honestly happened way too much, both the calls from the DM and unreasonable people making demands. I had to quit that job because I couldn't get fired no matter how hard I tried. It was worse for the people who tried to yell at my cashiers for shit far beyond their control. Immediately cancel their transactions and threaten to trespass them to the police. They were like 17-18. They don't need to deal with that shit at a part time job and I sure as fuck am not going to deal with it during my full time job.

A lot of misinformation starts to fly when people start talking about unionizing. Corporate at my old casino job told us that union dues would be 20% of our paychecks, that patrons would no longer tip us once our wages were raised, and that we would force massive layoffs and corporate might close the whole casino. It scared the shit out of a lot of people. Union dues ended up being 1.3% of the average member‚Äôs paycheck, and the lowest paid employees pretty much doubled their take homes. But people were scared of losing what little they had, and I don‚Äôt blame them.

rco8xd,witchezbrew,,hnx1das,"I don't work at Starbucks but I'll give a reason why I personally don't want a union. I want to be able to individually negotiate with my employer. I believe I do a better job than my coworkers, and I can negotiate a higher salary on my own than with a union. I've been in the workforce for 7 years now and my pay has gone up 300% during that time, including one time where my company refused to compensate me what I thought I was worth so I changed companies.

Meanwhile my wife is in a union and although the union does good work and is worth her dues (she had a personal conflict with a superior, and the union rep was able to successfully mediate and make sure she knew all of her rights under the negotiated contract), they also have negotiated a contract that is purely based on years of service rather than performance for salary. Basically there's people who have been working there for 30 years skating by barely doing good enough to not get fired and meanwhile she is innovating all over the place but making half the money that people doing a worse job are getting. Because in negotiations, her union is focusing on negotiating wages for all union members, they have no incentive to fight for strong performance based compensation because although some would receive more compensation it would actually likely lead to more members receiving a pay decrease, and when union elections give each person a vote regardless of performance, the incentives are towards maximizing pay for the most mediocre employee. Yes I know there are some unions that do have performance differentiations, but for the most part union jobs have more of a flat and seniority based pay structure rather than a performance based pay structure, whereas most non-union jobs have much bigger performance incentives.
