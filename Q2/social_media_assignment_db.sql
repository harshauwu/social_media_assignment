I\'ve been in the workforce for 7 years now and my pay has gone up 300% during that time, including one time where my company refused to compensate me what I thought I was worth so I changed companies.\n\nMeanwhile my wife is in a union and although the union does good work and is worth her dues (she had a personal conflict with a superior, and the union rep was able to successfully mediate and make sure she knew all of her rights under the negotiated contract), they also have negotiated a contract that is purely based on years of service rather than performance for salary. Basically there\'s people who have been working there for 30 years skating by barely doing good enough to not get fired and meanwhile she is innovating all over the place but making half the money that people doing a worse job are getting. Because in negotiations, her union is focusing on negotiating wages for all union members, they have no incentive to fight for strong performance based compensation because although some would receive more compensation it would actually likely lead to more members receiving a pay decrease, and when union elections give each person a vote regardless of performance, the incentives are towards maximizing pay for the most mediocre employee. Yes I know there are some unions that do have performance differentiations, but for the most part union jobs have more of a flat and seniority based pay structure rather than a performance based pay structure, whereas most non-union jobs have much bigger performance incentives.\n\nAgain not shitting on unions and I\'m not sure how much of this applies to Starbucks, but they\'re certainly not for everyone.',-4,1639092990,'/r/starbucks/comments/rco8xd/they_won_the_union_vote/hnx1das/',0,NULL,'dont work starbucks ill give reason personally dont want union want able individually negotiate employer believe better job coworkers negotiate higher salary union ive workforce 7 years pay gone 300 time including one time company refused compensate thought worth changed companies meanwhile wife union although union good work worth dues personal conflict superior union rep able successfully mediate make sure knew rights negotiated contract also negotiated contract purely based years service rather performance salary basically theres people working 30 years skating barely good enough get fired meanwhile innovating place making half money people worse job getting negotiations union focusing negotiating wages union members incentive fight strong performance based compensation although would receive compensation would actually likely lead members receiving pay decrease union elections give person vote regardless performance incentives towards maximizing pay mediocre employee yes know unions performance differentiations part union jobs flat seniority based pay structure rather performance based pay structure whereas nonunion jobs much bigger performance incentives shitting unions im sure much applies starbucks theyre certainly everyone','{\'neg\': 0.126, \'neu\': 0.673, \'pos\': 0.201, \'compound\': 0.9558}',0.9558,'positive',182),('rco8xd','witchezbrew','BreakGlitch','hnw8c6a','Fuck yeah!!!!!!',1,1639081017,'/r/starbucks/comments/rco8xd/they_won_the_union_vote/hnw8c6a/',1,NULL,'fuck yeah','{\'neg\': 0.614, \'neu\': 0.0, \'pos\': 0.386, \'compound\': -0.3182}',-0.3182,'negative',183),('rco8xd','witchezbrew','Natebored1','hnw9v4d','HELL YEAH',1,1639081625,'/r/starbucks/comments/rco8xd/they_won_the_union_vote/hnw9v4d/',1,NULL,'hell yeah','{\'neg\': 0.676, \'neu\': 0.0, \'pos\': 0.324, \'compound\': -0.5267}',-0.5267,'negative',184),('rco8xd','witchezbrew',NULL,'hnxe4u3','they’re usually just brainwashed.  so many companies spend a lot of time and money on misleading their employees',0,1639098706,'/r/starbucks/comments/rco8xd/they_won_the_union_vote/hnxe4u3/',0,NULL,'they’re usually brainwashed many companies spend lot time money misleading employees','{\'neg\': 0.213, \'neu\': 0.787, \'pos\': 0.0, \'compound\': -0.4019}',-0.4019,'negative',185),('rco8xd','witchezbrew','ihatemaps','hnwo6tc','1.

Two, I wear hearing aids and the accommodation was just I couldn\'t be on the drive-thru headset talking for over an hour because it made my ears ring.

Me, face tomato-red and on the verge of crying, and she wanted me to sit in front of all the other people I worked with while I \"waited for my mommy to pick me up\" as she said. Then, she asked if I wanted a drink. I said no, and she said \"Good, you would have to pay for it anyways, since you don\'t work for us anymore.\" Needless to say.

It was not kosher. ? \n\nAnyway, I was really upset. One of my shift managers told me, “this job is NOT worth killing your self and hurting yourself over, and it’s hard enough working here as an able bodied person. Don’t sweat it and do what’s best for you.” That really resonated with me.

(There wasn’t much else to do so we just cleaned constantly after morning rush.) One night i was closing with another barista and we were way behind schedule because we had some call offs and then a random rush 30 mins before closing. \n\nThis was on a Tuesday night. (that is important)\n\nMy barista and I were supposed to be out at 8, since a lot of corporations don’t like to give overtime, it was important that we got out at our scheduled times. Unfortunately we weren’t able to get out until around 9. since we had to do Clean Play. (For those of you that don’t know, it’s a deep clean of the store that happens once a week and you’re scheduled to work 2 hours after close to do it.) (so again for context: store closed at 6, we were to do cleanplay and be out at 8) \n\nwe were in a bit of a crunch because we still had to completely close down the bar and our last customer didn’t leave until right at 6 and we were told not to start taking stuff down until all customers are out of the store. so we were behind schedule.\n\neventually we start getting everything done and it’s all good and we’re stressed and just venting to each other while cleaning. finally, it’s all done and we’re way past 8 and i realize “oh shit! i forgot to do the cash!” so i pull the drawers, count the money, deposit profits into the slider safe and put the cash drawers in the big safe. (there’s a drawer on the safe to put cash into that deposits into a smaller safe inside the big one for double security). \n\nthen i close the safe door and we set the alarm and go home.\n\nWednesday my manager opened. I was off on Wednesday.\n\nThursday my manager was off. I was working Thursday.\n\nFriday my manager opened. I was off on Friday.\n\nSaturday i’m closing. My manager was off. \n\nSunday I’m working all day. My manager was off. \nbut i had to contact him for a question about someone wanting to leave early and he says he’s coming in a 2pm. okay cool. \n\nhe comes in and asks me if i can come into the back with him and i joking said “uh oh, rachel to the principals office” (nice going me) and when we get to his desk i see a manila folder and i look at him and again joking say “omg [his name] am i being fired?” and he tells me to sit down. (great) \n\nthe convo went as follows:\n\nManager: so what happened tuesday?\nMe: uh [barista] and i were doing cleanplay and we had a rush right before close and so we were behind on getting things done like i told you and then once we got it all done we went home.\nManager: okay\nMe: [Manager] be real, am I being fired for something?

Tipping is generally not expected, unlike in a proper restaurant setting where a tip is usually expected as a % of the total cost of your meal. \n\nAs a barista, most tipping I\'ve observed happens in a couple categories: \na) exceptional service. My coworker saw a child having an obviously bad day and gave them a cake pop for free. The mother liked this gesture and may choose to tip if she feels like it (but we didn\'t give the kid a cake pop because we want a tip, we gave it because the kid looked sad). \nOther things that people may consider good service are if they go to Starbucks every day and their drink is always made correctly and quickly, or if the barista were to show incredible patience and guidance when you\'re having difficulty trying to order an incredibly complicated drink.\nb) spare change. Before the card readers had a tip option, most of the tips I received were spare change. A lot of people don\'t feel like carrying around a bunch of coins, and would tip whatever change they got back from their transaction. This is also because here in Canada, $1 and $2 are coins as well as nickels, dimes, and quarters. I\'d say most of these \"keep the change\" tips were 75¢ or less. \nc) \"hassle charge\"/tip for difficulty. People may tip if they realise that what they\'ve ordered is going to be difficult and take a long time to make, like if they ordered 20 frappuccinos all at once or something like that. Or if the person themselves is being \"difficult\" and becomes self aware part way through the interaction, though that\'s rare lol.\n\n>If I don\'t tip, is the barista going to put less effort into making my drink, or worse, mess with it in some way?\n\nShort answer: No, absolutely not. \nFirst, the barista taking/cashing out an order is very often not the same person making the order. We have roles and positions to stick to. Most of the time, the barista making your drink has no way of knowing if you tipped or not. And honestly, even as the one *doing* the transaction, a lot of the time I don\'t even pay attention to whether someone tipped or not. \nSecond, nobody is going to care if you tip or not. The majority of people do not tip. There\'s nothing exceptional about *not* tipping. It\'s the default, the standard, the norm. The only time that I remember somebody not tipping is when they make a big deal about the fact that they don\'t want to tip me and throw an adult temper tantrum. Yes, it happens.\n\nAs for messing with your drink, it takes more effort to purposely mess something up than it does to make it properly. Also, Starbucks has a very liberal remake policy, so if something is wrong with a drink we\'ll just have to make it all over again. All the customer has to do is say \"this doesn\'t taste right\" and we\'ll make a new one. From a time and effort perspective, it never makes sense for me to mess up a drink on purpose. I\'ll have to use extra energy to break my muscle memory and come up with a way to fuck up a drink, and then I may have to remake it anyways.\n\nI\'ve met many customers who I thought were assholes and I have never made a drink incorrectly on purpose. Maybe because I\'m not incredibly spiteful, but also because individual rude customers are just not that important.\n\nAnd to reiterate: Not tipping at Starbucks isn\'t rude.\n\n>Are they going to remember me [...]?\n\nNo, probably not. I don\'t remember most customers if it\'s a normal interaction, and I am usually quite good with recognising faces. But I serve hundreds of customers in a week, they all blend together after a while. If there was a missing person and the police came and asked me, \"Did you serve a woman with long dark hair, glasses, in a pink hoodie driving a blue car?\" Even if I *wanted* to be helpful, I probably couldn\'t remember unless she was extraordinarily kind or extremely mean. If you are neither of those extremes, you are not memorable. \n\n>What am I tipping for?\nIs answered by, you\'ve got it:\n>Just as a bonus\n\nYou\'re not paying a barista\'s living wage because we don\'t generally make a livable wage, so worrying about that is not on your shoulders. And since tips are split among everyone working at the time, even a larger tip of $5 may work out to only a few cents for an individual,  depending on the number of baristas working. Unless you tip hundreds of dollars, it won\'t make a substantial difference to our wages.\n\nIf you\'re not saying any slurs, throwing any drinks, loudly insulting people or getting physically violent, you don\'t have to worry about ruining your barista\'s day. If you feel like your barista looks pissed or deflated after you don\'t tip, I can almost guarantee you that\'s a look of \"man I\'ve been here for only 6 hours and I already feel dead\" look and not a \"oh no! This is the 42nd person not to tip me today!\" look. Sometimes my coworkers will randomly ask me, \"are you okay?\" And I realise that despite feeling totally fine, my face is saying \"I hate my life\" unintentionally.\n\nAll of this sounds very dismissive of tips, so I\'ll add that we definitely do appreciate them and that many people choosing to be generous does add up over time, so it\'s a kind gesture. If you\'re someone with extra money to spare, us minimum wage employees thank you. But if you don\'t want to tip, that\'s fine, and you\'re putting yourself under a lot of undue stress right now thinking about this.\n\nI hope this is thorough enough to put your mind at ease. I know that I personally prefer detailed explanations to help me understand stuff so I hope that\'s your style too ?',2,1688582728,'/r/starbucks/comments/14qt995/anyone_else_embarrassed_to_say_the_customers/jqsgll7/',0,NULL,'tipping confusing ive tried provide full breakdown social conventions rules north america rule social convention tipping fast food places tipping generally expected unlike proper restaurant setting tip usually expected total cost meal barista tipping ive observed happens couple categories exceptional service coworker saw child obviously bad day gave cake pop free mother liked gesture may choose tip feels like didnt give kid cake pop want tip gave kid looked sad things people may consider good service go starbucks every day drink always made correctly quickly barista show incredible patience guidance youre difficulty trying order incredibly complicated drink b spare change card readers tip option tips received spare change lot people dont feel like carrying around bunch coins would tip whatever change got back transaction also canada 1 2 coins well nickels dimes quarters id say keep change tips 75¢ less c hassle chargetip difficulty people may tip realise theyve ordered going difficult take long time make like ordered 20 frappuccinos something like person difficult becomes self aware part way interaction though thats rare lol dont tip barista going put less effort making drink worse mess way short answer absolutely first barista takingcashing order often person making order roles positions stick time barista making drink way knowing tipped honestly even one transaction lot time dont even pay attention whether someone tipped second nobody going care tip majority people tip theres nothing exceptional tipping default standard norm time remember somebody tipping make big deal fact dont want tip throw adult temper tantrum yes happens messing drink takes effort purposely mess something make properly also starbucks liberal remake policy something wrong drink well make customer say doesnt taste right well make new one time effort perspective never makes sense mess drink purpose ill use extra energy break muscle memory come way fuck drink may remake anyways ive met many customers thought assholes never made drink incorrectly purpose maybe im incredibly spiteful also individual rude customers important reiterate tipping starbucks isnt rude going remember probably dont remember customers normal interaction usually quite good recognising faces serve hundreds customers week blend together missing person police came asked serve woman long dark hair glasses pink hoodie driving blue car even wanted helpful probably couldnt remember unless extraordinarily kind extremely mean neither extremes memorable tipping answered youve got bonus youre paying baristas living wage dont generally make livable wage worrying shoulders since tips split among everyone working time even larger tip 5 may work cents individual depending number baristas working unless tip hundreds dollars wont make substantial difference wages youre saying slurs throwing drinks loudly insulting people getting physically violent dont worry ruining baristas day feel like barista looks pissed deflated dont tip almost guarantee thats look man ive 6 hours already feel dead look oh 42nd person tip today look sometimes coworkers randomly ask okay realise despite feeling totally fine face saying hate life unintentionally sounds dismissive tips ill add definitely appreciate many people choosing generous add time kind gesture youre someone extra money spare us minimum wage employees thank dont want tip thats fine youre putting lot undue stress right thinking hope thorough enough put mind ease know personally prefer detailed explanations help understand stuff hope thats style','{\'neg\': 0.147, \'neu\': 0.707, \'pos\': 0.146, \'compound\': -0.7472}',-0.7472,'negative',2143),('14qt995','keyuukat','sublimeshivers','jqr2pfs','I can assure you you\'re overthinking this.

I cannot duplicate a Starbucks Iced Brown Sugar shaken Oatmilk Espresso. I can not duplicate the refreshers, the Fraps, etc. That’s why customers go to places like Starbucks. Yes, if I want a simple cup of coffee, I make that at home. If I want something special, I go to Starbucks, because that is what Starbucks is in the business of doing. That’s the service they offer, that’s what we pay for. It is not mandatory that I pay extra on top of that, when I’m in the mood for that special service their business model offers me just because they don’t pay their employees a living wage. And that if I “can’t afford”to do so, I should just “stay home”. Why should I, or any other paying customer forfeit something special for ourselves and punish ourselves with the same old, same old cup of coffee from our kitchen coffee makers, because YOU feel it’s on the customer and not the company to pay for your living expenses? \n\nAnd for the record, it’s wrong for you to assume I don’t tip, just because I understand the whole entire point of Starbucks and what the customer is supposed to be paying for. No one should have to “stay home” rather than enjoy purchasing a drink from a business whose entire existence is for the sole purpose of making special drinks you can’t make at home, Especially if they “can’t afford” to tip.

This is true for practically any publicly traded company. They can make ~3,000,000 in revenue a day by increasing the prices by twenty cents and that can help the stores pay employees more wages, because it’s becoming really laughable as gen z enters the workforce to make anything around minimum wage so companies have to raise their ROP especially in metropolitan areas. \n\nThey’re not….not…ever going to operate that way.

Mostly by becoming more expensive :( But there\'s a few things to look for that should help you tell if you\'re in a tipping-expected environment or not.\n\nAre you seated to eat? Does a server come to take your order where you\'re sitting? Does a server check in on how your meal is going? Do they collect your dishes/napkins/utensils when you\'re finished? Do you receive the bill at the end of the service? Are there any signs about what % would make a good tip? If yes to most of these things, tipping is likely expected.\n\nDo many people here take their food to-go? Do you pay for your food at a cash register at the same time as you order it? Is a name/number called out, and you pick up your food from a counter? Does the store have a drive-through? Are there garbage cans where you\'re expected to dispose of your own garbage (straws, cups, napkins, etc)? If these are true, you\'re probably at a fast food restaurant, and tipping may be an *option* but it is not an *expectation*. \n\nBonus, if a card reader has no obvious option for no tip besides putting in $0.00 as a custom amount, tipping is likely expected. If there\'s a \"NO THANK YOU\" button for no tip, that may be a sign that it\'s optional. But card readers vary a lot from place to place, so don\'t just rely on this, it\'s not the best way to tell.\n\nThen there are places like hairdressers or private transportation (taxi) where tips may be expected, but these of course don\'t fit the mould of a sit-down restaurant since they\'re entirely different services. You\'ve just got to be aware that these other tipping places are out there and not be surprised when the tip options show up.\n\nIf you\'re ever somewhere that even with context clues, you can\'t figure out if you\'re supposed to tip: Just ask. I know it\'s scary and just the thought of asking might make you nervous. I\'m saying this as someone who still has to take a few minutes to work up the nerve to make a simple phone call to the doctor\'s office. But really, it\'s not a big deal. Just: \"Hey, sorry if this is an odd question, but is tipping expected here or optional?\" That\'s it. Just a question. Rehearse saying it or write it down if it\'d make you feel better. \n\nI think one of the most reassuring things that working at sbux has taught me is this: You\'re not memorable, and nobody really cares that much. Seriously, it sounds rude, but your average retail worker sees so many people a day that they probably won\'t remember you. And even if they remember you tomorrow, they probably won\'t in a week, or a month. \n\n Tipping is confusing, so if someone asks a question about it, it\'s not memorable. Even silly questions, like \"Is grilled cheese your only vegan sandwich?\" I can remember the question itself, but not the person that asked it. If I remembered every person that asked a \"dumb\" question, my brain would be too full of faces to remember anything else, lol.',1,1688590840,'/r/starbucks/comments/14qt995/anyone_else_embarrassed_to_say_the_customers/jqt1fhs/',0,NULL,'tipping doesnt exactly blackand white rules since whole landscape tipping north america least seems ever evolving changing mostly becoming expensive theres things look help tell youre tippingexpected environment seated eat server come take order youre sitting server check meal going collect dishesnapkinsutensils youre finished receive bill end service signs would make good tip yes things tipping likely expected many people take food togo pay food cash register time order namenumber called pick food counter store drivethrough garbage cans youre expected dispose garbage straws cups napkins etc true youre probably fast food restaurant tipping may option expectation bonus card reader obvious option tip besides putting 000 custom amount tipping likely expected theres thank button tip may sign optional card readers vary lot place place dont rely best way tell places like hairdressers private transportation taxi tips may expected course dont fit mould sitdown restaurant since theyre entirely different services youve got aware tipping places surprised tip options show youre ever somewhere even context clues cant figure youre supposed tip ask know scary thought asking might make nervous im saying someone still take minutes work nerve make simple phone call doctors office really big deal hey sorry odd question tipping expected optional thats question rehearse saying write itd make feel better think one reassuring things working sbux taught youre memorable nobody really cares much seriously sounds rude average retail worker sees many people day probably wont remember even remember tomorrow probably wont week month tipping confusing someone asks question memorable even silly questions like grilled cheese vegan sandwich remember question person asked remembered every person asked dumb question brain would full faces remember anything else lol','{\'neg\': 0.083, \'neu\': 0.799, \'pos\': 0.118, \'compound\': 0.8968}',0.8968,'positive',2174),('14qt995','keyuukat',NULL,'jqucf0y','[deleted]',1,1688612127,'/r/starbucks/comments/14qt995/anyone_else_embarrassed_to_say_the_customers/jqucf0y/',0,NULL,'deleted','{\'neg\': 0.0, \'neu\': 1.0, \'pos\': 0.0, \'compound\': 0.0}',0,'neutral',2175),('14qt995','keyuukat','Creativecrazydreamer','jqukw18','Yes!',1,1688616733,'/r/starbucks/comments/14qt995/anyone_else_embarrassed_to_say_the_customers/jqukw18/',0,NULL,'yes','{\'neg\': 0.0, \'neu\': 0.0, \'pos\': 1.0, \'compound\': 0.4019}',0.4019,'positive',2176),('14qt995','keyuukat','Mediocre_Superiority','jqp7xf3','I applaud your creative hacks!

He would sit in front of our store every day of the week (Monday-Sunday) from right when we open to when we close (opened at 5am and closed at 8:30pm). Like literally would just sit in his “stick out like a sore thumb” van and not do anything. There were other shops and restaurants around the parking lot where our store was but he would never ever go to them or even work.\n\nHis van was the ugliest car I’ve ever seen. It was a maroon van with ? brown patches on it, like he just took a paintbrush and randomly brushed spots of the color onto his van. And he put an ad for his landscaping company on the back windshield with those white letter sticks you buy from craft stores. So it was a very shady ad. ?\n\nAnd here’s the two kickers, he would only come into to our store to use our bathroom (5 times a day)but he hardly ordered anything beside 3 black blonde roast coffees every day!! And he would bring in a woman in on a “date”. And get this, he would bring in a NEW woman ??EVERY??SINGLE??DAY??, and most of these women didn’t speak English, so he would communicate with them using a translator app so that was kinda embarrassing to watch, plus the women never looked happy or excited to be with him (shocker! ?).\n\nWe also called him “The Starbucks Stalker” bc he followed multiple women home from the store, either partners or customers. (Most of them were high school students or younger women, this guy was in his late 50s- early 60s) And we had lots of complaints from both parties. But we never called the police bc of not wanting to drive it to extremes. \n\nHe FINALLY left for good after a SSV’s boyfriend went out and told him off. He never came back. \n\nThank goodness.

I have a meeting later.” and I said “Then go to your appointment.” and he says, “No, I want to stay with you until your break is over.” Keep in mind that earlier (when I was doing the modules), I had told him that I was 16 after he asked for my age.\nNow, any time that he comes in and sees me, he calls me Dana despite my name tag with my actual name & me telling him multiple times that that’s not my name.

Ditto for alt milk chais— if you’re vegan, which side of the honey fence are you on? This changes how we’ll  make it for you. (Concentrate v tea bag latte) \n\nHOWEVER…. Some folks SHOULD have some idea about some food and willfully ignore what’s right in front of them. \n\nThe number of T2 diabetics that STILL drink venti white mochas with brown sugar/hazelnut/toffee nut/whatever extra flavor AND VSC/VSCCF and extra caramel drizzle AND get a sweet pastry for breakfast daily astounds me. \n\nI’m not the diet police, but I have a real judgy face, so I’ll tell them the truth when they ask or they’re all “tee here I’m diabetic but this is my one treat today.” \n\nMa’am. First of all, we can all now safely guess how you got here. This isn’t the only way to get T2 diabetes — sometimes it just happens and genetics are a bitch —but it’s the fast track. Secondly, blood sugar doesn’t work like that and there is no way you’re falling off that sugar cliff and not chasing another sugar high. You need to LISTEN to a dietician. Not just your doctor, they usually don’t know shit about nutrition, it’s about 14 seconds of medical school. Go to a registered dietitian. Often larger grocery store chains employ them and appointments are covered by insurance. If you’re in Texas, the H-E-B ones are great and do telehealth appointments. \n\nYou can still have Starbucks and have a healthy diet, but you can’t have everything on the menu, especially not every day and basically nothing that goes in the blender. And lastly, don’t you like your money, feet and eyes? Diabetes is expensive as hell to manage, even if you’re not taking insulin. \n\nA sugar addiction is a thing you need to get ahold of real quick so your pancreas doesn’t completely call it quits on you. Food addiction is tough; get some help and treat it seriously so you can live a good long life. \n\nAlso, black coffee or tea can be delicious. Retrain your palate and brain. Even if you have to step it down one pump/one modifier at a time. We can help with that! Rome wasn’t built in a day. \n\nAlso, obviously T1 is a whole different beast, is no joke, and constant vigilance is required. \n\n(I’m not diabetic, but have both T1 and T2 family members. I’ve had to follow all the above advice for heart/vascular/stroke issues. Do I miss butter, most dairy, most meat and more? Fuck yeah, but not as much as I don’t miss worrying about dropping dead every time I get a headache. It’s a real inconvenient diet sometimes too, especially coupled with food allergies. Yes, it sucks not being able to have everything you want all the time. You’ll be fine.

We rounded up a bag of green coffee beans and a home coffee roaster and then brought half of the beans to a classic light roast and the rest to a dark roast. After grinding the batches separately in a burr grinder, we brewed two pots of coffee, using the same volume of ground coffee per batch (1/2 cup per 3 1/2 cups of water), and sent both to a lab for testing. When the results came back, we learned that the light roast had much more caffeine than the dark roast—60 percent more in this particular case. Perplexed, we decided to see what would happen if we measured the ground coffee by weight instead. We made two more pots to send to the lab, measuring out 1 1/2 ounces of ground coffee per 3 1/2 cups of water. As we added ground coffee to the scale, we noticed that it took 2 1/2 more tablespoons of dark roast than light roast to reach 1 1/2 ounces. Nevertheless, when the results came back, we saw that both pots had virtually the same amount of caffeine.\n\nIt turns out that as the beans roast, they lose water and also puff up slightly—and the longer the roast time the more pronounced these effects. Dark roast beans will thus weigh less (and be slightly larger) than light roast beans. When the ground beans are measured by volume, the light roast particles will be denser, weigh more, and contain more caffeine than the dark grinds, producing a more caffeinated brew.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: The only way to ensure that you’re getting the same amount of caffeine with different roasts (all other variables being equal) is to weigh coffee. If you measure by volume, you’ll end up with more buzz with a light roast than with a dark roast.',14,1683729927,'/r/starbucks/comments/13d7a78/starbucks_caffeine_levels/jjlxmos/',0,NULL,'cooks illustrated coffee beans roasted different degrees produce specific flavors whether process affects caffeine level question many us test kitchen also rounded bag green coffee beans home coffee roaster brought half beans classic light roast rest dark roast grinding batches separately burr grinder brewed two pots coffee using volume ground coffee per batch 12 cup per 3 12 cups water sent lab testing results came back learned light roast much caffeine dark roast—60 percent particular case perplexed decided see would happen measured ground coffee weight instead made two pots send lab measuring 1 12 ounces ground coffee per 3 12 cups water added ground coffee scale noticed took 2 12 tablespoons dark roast light roast reach 1 12 ounces nevertheless results came back saw pots virtually amount caffeine turns beans roast lose water also puff slightly—and longer roast time pronounced effects dark roast beans thus weigh less slightly larger light roast beans ground beans measured volume light roast particles denser weigh contain caffeine dark grinds producing caffeinated brew bottom line way ensure you’re getting amount caffeine different roasts variables equal weigh coffee measure volume you’ll end buzz light roast dark roast','{\'neg\': 0.026, \'neu\': 0.954, \'pos\': 0.019, \'compound\': -0.3182}',-0.3182,'negative',4756),('13d7a78','Equivalent_Garlic697','TitleBulky4087','jjlgskx','Which is why mochas are dairy free but white mochas aren’t! ?thank you',11,1683722350,'/r/starbucks/comments/13d7a78/starbucks_caffeine_levels/jjlgskx/',0,NULL,'mochas dairy free white mochas aren’t thank','{\'neg\': 0.0, \'neu\': 0.463, \'pos\': 0.537, \'compound\': 0.7003}',0.7003,'positive',4757),('13d7a78','Equivalent_Garlic697','happybonobo1','jjl6ehe','yes',6,1683716283,'/r/starbucks/comments/13d7a78/starbucks_caffeine_levels/jjl6ehe/',0,':Customer: Customer','yes','{\'neg\': 0.0, \'neu\': 0.0, \'pos\': 1.0, \'compound\': 0.4019}',0.4019,'positive',4758),('13d7a78','Equivalent_Garlic697','Goonie90065','jjlwcdm','I’ve always gotten Refreshers, Frappuccino if I needed a pick me up but recently tried a Cold Brew and loved it but did notice I like it alittle more sweeter.',1,1683729398,'/r/starbucks/comments/13d7a78/starbucks_caffeine_levels/jjlwcdm/',1,NULL,'i’ve always gotten refreshers frappuccino needed pick recently tried cold brew loved notice like alittle sweeter','{\'neg\': 0.0, \'neu\': 0.686, \'pos\': 0.314, \'compound\': 0.7506}',0.7506,'positive',4759),('13d7a78','Equivalent_Garlic697','osrpokerchamp','jjmpdib','Yes, but it\'s approximately 25 mg in a grande.',4,1683740578,'/r/starbucks/comments/13d7a78/starbucks_caffeine_levels/jjmpdib/',0,':Barista: Barista','yes approximately 25 mg grande','{\'neg\': 0.0, \'neu\': 0.597, \'pos\': 0.403, \'compound\': 0.4019}',0.4019,'positive',4760),('13d7a78','Equivalent_Garlic697','roundfarm1','jjjrerr','I’m guessing because it’s diluted with water',94,1683682025,'/r/starbucks/comments/13d7a78/starbucks_caffeine_levels/jjjrerr/',0,':Barista: Barista','i’m guessing it’s diluted water','{\'neg\': 0.0, \'neu\': 1.0, \'pos\': 0.0, \'compound\': 0.0}',0,'neutral',4761),('13d7a78','Equivalent_Garlic697','bigdbillium','jjjx6zu','because your getting less per cup because the ice takes up volume',6,1683684650,'/r/starbucks/comments/13d7a78/starbucks_caffeine_levels/jjjx6zu/',0,NULL,'getting less per cup ice takes volume','{\'neg\': 0.0, \'neu\': 1.0, \'pos\': 0.0, \'compound\': 0.0}',0,'neutral',4762),('13d7a78','Equivalent_Garlic697','Necessary_Low939','jjlwoaj','Thanks.

There had to be at least 15 items of that list.\n\nI stood there waiting in line with my little boy in my arms for a minute or so, when a barista approached me and asked if he could get something started for me.

I don’t know this guy, have never met him or seen him. I’m not a regular at this particular location. And he was so, so kind. I had tears in my eyes and told him how much I appreciated his kindness. Life hasn’t been particularly easy on me lately and I just really needed to hear this today. \n\nI left all the cash I had on me in the tip jar - $8 which I realize was more than the cost of my drink but his little gesture stuck with me and he deserved it. \n\nCried all the way to music class.

I pick up coffee every morning on my way to work.  At this point, I haven’t missed a day in over two years.  Sometimes I use the drive thru, but mostly I place my order on the app and run inside to pick it up. \n\nWhat I am met with, each and every day from the baristas is a smile and a warm hello.  Yes, I’m a regular, so they all know me at this point.  But I see them do it to everyone.  Whether or not you’re asked by management to do this is beside the point.  It’s genuine, and I can tell.  \n\nTo all baristas:  Thank you.  I’m convinced you don’t hear that enough. \n\nMorning is an interesting time of day.  When you see your customers, their day has either gotten off to a good start, or a bad one.  Too often you’re on the front lines of someone fighting a bad day.  They make you the face of their problems and lash out, nearly always, for no reason.  I’ve seen it happen. \n\nI can’t think of a place that requires multitasking more than Starbucks.  I watch you.  I’m in awe of you, honestly.  You are taking endless orders, all customized, while handling cash transactions and listening to gripes from customers.  And the Karens.  There are so many Karens. \n\nThe teamwork you display on a minute-to-minute basis is inspiring.  As a hiring manager of my own firm, seeing Starbucks Barista on a resume will always get my attention.  You are such a talented and hardworking group.  You may argue that there are exceptions, and surely, anytime you employ as many as you do, there will be exceptions.  But they are so few and far between.  They are not who I’m talking to.  I’m talking to YOU.  Thank YOU. \n\nYour coffee literally makes my day better.  Even when there’s not enough cream.  Or too much cream.  Or it’s not hot enough.  Whatever.  It’s coffee.  The world will not begin or end with my coffee.\n\nBut I know my day will begin with a smile from my barista.  And for that, I am grateful.','Upper-Dot9517','starbucks','2022-08-31','18:28:54'),('She asked for an ungodly amount of drizzle so I complied.',1745,'x1pvos','https://www.reddit.com/gallery/x1pvos',102,'2022-08-30 18:01:19',NULL,NULL,'starbucks','2022-08-30','18:01:19'),('SBUX: CUSTOMER CONNECTIONS!!!..

There were no drive-throughs and our food started and ended with pastries. It was a coffeeshop, a \"Third Place.\" Congenial, friendly, intimate, fun. \n\nI left for a long time. During this time Howard Schulz stepped down and McCafe started. Starbucks felt threatened by this cheaper, industrial, no-personality option. The smell of food began to overwhelm the smell of espresso, the drive-through began to overwhelm the café, the mobile orders came, and the look and feel of the fun beatnik hangout spot turned into a corporate industry frantically running against time. The look of happiness on the barista\'s faces was replaced by a grim and overwhelmed blankness.\n\nThe coffees, too, disappeared. Arabian Mocha Java, Sulaweisi, Kenya, Sanani, New Guinea Peaberry... the interesting and fun variety subsumed into the bland and mediocre Pike Place and a few others to adapt to a market Starbucks was never meant to cater to. \n\nStarbucks is at a loss trying to figure out how to improve connection scores and the Third Place feel. Well, that\'s really dumb. They know what the problem is; they have to. It\'s not just me that said this stuff, Howard Schulz said it himself repeatedly. It\'s no secret. \n\nIf you want to be a Third Place, it can\'t be industrial. If you want it to be industrial, it can\'t be a Third Place.  Get rid of the drive through, get rid of the fast food.

Or 3) comments on horror stories telling the op to unionize.\n\nI’m an organizer at one of the newer stores to have filed to unionize, and I want to share with you the very broad strokes of how we got the ball rolling. The whole idea seemed so nebulous and scary at first, but once you have your partners on board, it’s actually surprisingly easy to start. I hope that sharing my experience will make the whole thing less intimidating.\n\nAlso: you may have your opinions on whether or not Unionizing is right for you. This post isn’t really about that conversation. This is just to help people who DO want to unionize figure out where to start. Please be nice.\n\n**Step one: Reach out.**\n\nNo seriously. If you are even thinking about wanting to unionize, reach out to Starbucks Workers United. They’re on twitter u/SBWorkersUnited and you can even email sbworkersunited@gmail.com to get some advice at any stage. Likely there’s a store close to you that’s already organizing that they can put you in contact with. I’ve spoken with partners from four stores in the past couple of months and helped to answer questions and I know other stores are doing the same.\n\nSWU also has materials that are very useful tools. They have stuff for talking points with partners who may be on the fence. They have insights into tactics that corporate is using to bust the unions. They have a lot of very helpful and empowering information that they are more than willing to give to you.\n\n**Step two: Talk to your partners.**\n\nThis step is really the most important step. The rest is just paperwork. The whole point of a union is to band together with your coworkers to negotiate to make your workplace better. Start with one person you trust and agrees with you and build from there. I was really lucky with my store and everyone was basically just waiting for someone to hand them a union card. Once I realized that, I sent an email. I know everyone’s stores can be different. Some people are aggressively anti-union and some people might simply not see the point. It really depends on your situation as to what you should do here.\n\nI recommend getting 3 or 4 of your partners at least who are willing to help you organize. At my store, the 4 of us just shared a group text message where we discussed everything. This helps spread the workload around so no one gets overwhelmed – or when someone does, they can pull back and rely on the others to fill in. Try to get a person who represents each day part as well. At the stores we’ve been talking to, a lot of the night crew is hella on board already probably because managers are rarely there, so they have more unsupervised time to talk about things.\n\nBE CAREFUL. At this stage you’re vulnerable so you’ll have to be strategic. Have a narc for a ssv? Try talking to your baristas after you get off or outside of work. Ssv’s on your side but your SM is a devil? Talk to each other on the weekends when they’re not there. It’s a bit easier to bring up unions now. I asked a lot of “what do you think about what happened in Buffalo?” to gauge the level of interest.\n\nAnd of course, if you ever feel like you don’t know what to do next, circle back to step one. There are a lot of us who are invested in helping each other. Whether that’s a zoom call, a text, or a “you can do it!”\n\nOnce you have most of your store on board, continue to step three.\n\n**Step Three:** **Seriously, contact Starbucks Workers United.**\n\nI’m listing this as a step three because this was actually my step two. (Whoops). I waited until literally my whole store was ready before I ever reached out. So, if you’re like me and have skipped step one, this is when you’ll 100% have to reach out. SWU will provide you with materials you may be missing and walk you through the next few steps.\n\n**Step Four: Gather signatures.**\n\nWorkers United will send you the pdf to the cards to hand to your coworkers. Technically you only need \\~30% of your store to sign to file. But I\'d recommend getting as many people as you can to sign. Starbucks will launch a huge anti-union campaign once you file and you want as many people aware of what’s going as possible. A big part of union busting is to create division on your team, so you’ll want as many people on your side as possible.\n\n**Step Five: Create a group chat.**\n\nYou may notice a common theme here, and it’s communicating to your partners. A LOT. Lol. At this point my store created a group chat with everyone who’d signed cards. This way we’d be able to share everything with everyone as soon as we knew. The closer we are, the harder it is to divide us.\n\nStep Six: Write your letters and file.\n\nYou’ll have to write your petition to the NLRB and a letter to Kevin Johnson. You’ll also have to scan your cards and submit the actual documents to the NLRB. It’s okay if you don’t know wtf to do. We asked a million questions over and over throughout this process. I’m still not entirely sure if my partner emailed Kevin Johnson directly or went through Workers United. *I guess the point I’m trying to make is that these steps can sound intimidating, but you’ll have people holding your hand through the whole thing if you need it.*\n\n**Aftermath:**\n\nYay you’ve filed!! Now what? You’ll let the world know you’ve filed. You now have legal protection as well as the protection of public opinion. If Starbucks does something dodgy, you have ways to hold them accountable.\n\nAt work there’ll be a whole lot of nothing for a few days except a grumpy store manager. But then expect visits from DM’s and Regional Directors asking how they can support you (technically illegal after filing but whatever). You’ll get emails from them as well as new signs in the back. Take pictures of everything. I literally send everything they post to our lawyer. Outside of work, you’ll likely have hella interviews with local news stations because this is a big deal. *Again, don’t be too freaked out by this.* You’ll be walked through some media training. And if interviews aren’t really your thing, find someone who’s comfortable with it. Make it fun! The whole point of a Union is to have a team of coworkers on your side.\n\nThat’s all I have right now. But I know from being online and seeing what they’ve done in Buffalo that we have tons of captive audience meetings and stuff ahead of us. It’ll be annoying but knowing there is an end to this makes it a bit easier. My tip to you is to prepare your people for what they’re getting into from the jump. The more you know going in, the less likely you\'ll be caught off guard when the bs starts. I will say that the more stores that file (and there are so so many coming soon) the harder it will be for corporate to launch full scale attacks like in Buffalo. Things may very well get easier as more of us move to unionize. There’s more of us than there are of them. And that’s what scares corporate so much.\n\nI know work has been hell for a lot of us recently. I know unions are a controversial topic. But if you’ll indulge my soapbox moment, I think that we are living through a time that could completely change how our labor is valued. It’s bigger than your single store, it’s bigger than this company.\n\nThis is the most excited I’ve felt about working at Starbucks in over half a decade and it’s because the people I work with are coming together and fighting for each other.\n\nAnnnnnyway. I’ll get down off this soapbox. Hopefully this was educational. Hopefully this made the whole process seem less scary. Hopefully it inspired a few of you to start the process at your stores. Maybe you just found it interesting.\n\nIf you need any more info or contact information, feel free to DM me!

Sometimes it was her, sometimes her assistant in her stead. Nothing extravagant: they were $5 each for junior employees and $10 for senior, and she’d give upwards of $30 to her higher level directors and whatnot. Was this in lieu of a Christmas bonus? No way of knowing for sure. All I knew was that Karen had chosen me to be the person who had to handle the transaction on whatever day she waltzed in to make her ~$4500 gift card purchase. She asked for me by name if I wasn’t already on the floor, and actually followed me to my new stores when I transferred to make sure it was me who did it. I still don’t know why - maybe I did such a mind-blowing job my first year that I got in her good graces? I got good and fast at it in my later years, but even at the height of my powers it still took at least 20 minutes to power through all those suckers because Karen refused to buy the multipacks. She said she didn’t trust them. (That’s a fun moment of irony for later in this story.) She also refused to buy bulk gift cards online, when that option became available, for the same reason. It had to be in person, individual gift cards, 400 of them, all at once. I had to split up the transactions because the POS wouldn’t let you charge more than $2k on one transaction. The same routine every year, without fail. Her receipts were epic. I wore them as scarves.\n\nWell, her company is local, and her employees often came in, too. I don’t work for Starbucks anymore, but I guess she hit up the store a little earlier than usual this year, and her employees already had their gift cards as of last week. Two of them came in together and tried to use their gift cards with my former coworker. Neither card was loaded with anything, even though they’d just gotten them recently. One employee turned to the other, rolling their eyes, and said “What a shocker. Have you ever gotten one that worked?” The other guy scoffed and said no, that it was year four and he had yet to get a working one. They paid like normal and walked away.\n\nToday my same coworker was on reg again, and one of those same employees came in again and recognized her. He said they found out what happened with their gift cards, and he was, like, vibrating with glee telling my coworker about it: Apparently Karen did, in fact, hand out Starbucks cards in lieu of bonuses. But the gift cards never worked, and finally this year someone with enough clout got annoyed enough about it that they went to Karen to find out what the deal was with the fucking things. Turns out, after her spree every year, Karen would tell her credit card company that her card had been stolen, and those $2k charges would get blocked, meaning every single gift card she bought was rendered inert. All to avoid spending any extra money at all on her employees at Christmas. Her assistant apparently confessed to the whole scheme, and now her board is pressuring her into granting Christmas bonuses for everyone in the company because they all threatened to quit. Possibly including the board, it was unclear from the, like, fourth hand story my coworker told me.\n\nI can’t make this shit up, y’all. Even after leaving, some customers continue to amaze me with their commitment to scumbaggery. I hope all her employees quit and then sue her.','untilcomplete','starbucks','2021-12-12','08:57:57'),('Be careful of corporate shills on this subreddit in the next few days',1844,'rd90sb','https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/rd90sb/be_careful_of_corporate_shills_on_this_subreddit/',68,'2021-12-10 13:47:26','Former partner who left SBUX for a union job here.

I sent this message via work chat to Kevin Johnson. \n\nI am removing particular details to maintain my identity. \n\n\nHi Kevin. My name is..., and I managed the Starbucks in.... I\'ve put in my two weeks, but I\'m amazed at the outrage and honesty that\'s being demonstrated in the message that has your name attached to it in Store Communications. \n\nI have no intentions on continuing my career with Starbucks, so perhaps that gives me the courage to finally speak up. \n\nI am amazed at the consistent disconnect between management and store level partners. \n\nI believed in Starbucks. Past tense. It’s been a few years since I believed that this was about coffee, or even our mission and values.\n\nI admire that we consistently live up to our shareholder’s expectations.\n\nI am often impressed by the dividends that we pay out. \n\nI would like to see Starbucks continue to thrive as a company.\n\nHowever, I have had the impression for quite some time that we, as a company, are not aware of the workloads that we place upon our store level partners, and how the pay is not representative of the physical or emotional tolls that working with the general public places upon us.\n\nI am consistently amazed at the lack of feedback that we seek out. Coaching upward was a phrase we used when I began with Starbucks six years ago. However, we seem to only demand downward now.\n\nI wonder if you are aware of the general attitude of your store managers in the mid-Atlantic region, that we are overworked, and the requirements of the position to succeed.\n\nI also wonder if you are aware of the general sentiments of our shift supervisor and barista teams in the mid-Atlantic region.\n\nI of course can’t speak to the status entire company, however if you were to take anonymous surveys of the store level partners in this region, you may be surprised at the dissatisfied responses (or, perhaps, worse, you wouldn’t be surprised).\n\nI also know that statistical anomalies are statistical anomalies because they do not occur often. \n\nWe are most likely not unique. \n\nWe are underpaying our shift supervisors for what we expect of them. Many of them can get jobs that pay better with significantly less responsibility.\n\nWhile our benefits package is absolutely fantastic, the low pay fails to acknowledge that many hourly partners struggle to pay rent or put food on their table.\n\nWhen programs like Lyra and Headspace roll out, it’s infuriating. You are acknowledging the issues that we face while failing to acknowledge why these issues arise in so many.\n\nYou are curing the symptoms without diagnosing the disease.\n\nGiving someone pain killers to cure the migraines caused by cancer does not fix the cancer. \n\nPlease stop with the platitudes and begin addressing us as the intelligent human beings that we are. You cannot create a company culture with the propaganda. \n\nIt begins with the top.\n\nWe as a company do not live up to our Mission and Values anymore. \n\nWe fail to challenge our status quo; we are not connecting with our store level partners with transparency, and when you fail at transparency you fail at dignity or respect.\n\nEverything that is coming out of Seattle is presented as disingenuous and disconnected to hourly partners.\n\nWithout them, you wouldn’t be able to collect your paycheck or stock options.\n\nPlease reconsider how you’re connecting with us.\n\nIf we are heard, acknowledged, and our conditions were improved, you might find that our productivity would increase significantly.\n\nI challenge you to challenge the status quo.\n\nI challenge you to connect transparently, respectfully, and with dignity.\n\nI challenge you to hold yourself accountable for the results of our current decisions.\n\nI challenge you to create the culture we had, of warmth and belonging.\n\nI challenge you to inspire the spirit of your partners again.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\nMe\n\nEdit: I was on the fence when I posted this about requesting people to share it. \n\nIf you know anyone who would benefit from this, please share, partner or not. \n\nIf we present a happy face to the public, they do not know the struggles we face on a daily basis. \n\nThey don’t understand why drive thru times are high. \n\nThey do not understand why they are waiting for their latte. \n\nIf we do not speak up, management will never know what it is that we are facing on a daily basis. \n\nWe stand stronger together. \n\nHave a lovely day everyone, and for those of you who share my sentiment, I hope things improve for you.\n\nEdit 2: I’m realizing now that customers are coming here as well. I’d like to share the [Partner Promise that was shared by Kevin Johnson on our PartnerHub. I’m glad someone else shared it. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/i2uktd/no_hazard_pay_but_we_get_this_partner_promise/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \n\nThe reception from partners thus far has been almost entirely negative.\n\nEdit 3: It’s been so fantastic to hear from so many of you the unique and varied experiences this company is facing. It also breaks my heart that so many of us feel this way with so little recourse. I need to call it a night, but I’ll be sure to respond to everyone I’ve missed tomorrow.

I work in a store with 5 highly at risk partners.

So, our store sent her and 10 other morning people (including 3 shifts that are useless idiots anyways) \non a paid 14 vacation. Store hours changed. My job got alot harder.\n\nShe didnt test positive and no morning person even got tested because why would they be cautious.\n\nI had been working 6 day weeks since and coming in during mids and closing the store with my closing partners. I have contact with 70% of the people in my store because of covered shifts. In my most recent week I worked with every single barista we have. We do our best and I monitor how my partners are feeling almost religiously. Sunday, at 5pm during a close my father tests positive. He took his test a week prior and we live together. I hadnt shown symptoms at all. Oh shit right? Wrong.\n\nThey send just me home and then the next day I test positive. What do they do? They tell me I dont have symptoms and therefore the store isnt closing and only 2 partners I worked with go home. The store doesnt even know that I tested positive until I stir shit up in the group chat. My friends, my coworkers are terrified that I gave it to them. My district manager ignores them. My fellow idiot shifts tell them not to panic. I JUST WANT THEM TO GO GET TESTED AND THE CUSTOMERS DONT EVEN KNOW THAT THE ENTIRE NIGHT SHIFT PROBABLY HAS COVID BECAUSE OF ME\n\nStarbucks doesnt care if you have covid. They care about when you tell them you sneezed. People are going to drop like flies soon.

If I sound condescending at all, believe me, it\'s not intentional. I\'m trying to help. \n\nI know a huge trend right now is to get drinks with light or no ice, maybe a cup of ice on the side (partly fueled by TikTok hack videos and the like). Sure, you get more for your money. And I know this bothers a lot of baristas. It annoys me a little, but I\'m on the side of, \"It\'s not my money, and Starbucks wouldn\'t let it happen if they weren\'t still making profit.\"\n\nThere\'s one problem that I think a lot of customers aren\'t aware of and that\'s our handcrafted recipes. To elaborate (and this is where I\'m afraid I\'ll sound condescending but don\'t mean to be), every Starbucks drink is made to standard by a certain specific recipe. There\'s a certain number of shots or pumps of this or scoops of that. I feel like some people think we just open a spout and the iced caramel macchiato comes pouring out and if you ask for less ice, you get more caramel macchiato. \n\nThe truth is if you take something away, we have to add something else to fill the space. A lot of times this is just extra milk, which can change the taste of the drink because it\'s more \"watered down.\" For example, if you order an iced venti chai, light ice, there\'s still only six pumps of chai. We\'re just pouring in more milk. If do the same with a caramel macchiato, we don\'t automatically add more vanilla or espresso. \n\nMy point is that if you\'re asking for light/no ice because you want more drink, but you don\'t ask for extra ingredients, the drink will taste different and that can lead to a sad experience. This isn\'t so much a problem with teas or refreshers but a lot of other drinks are affected. Unfortunately, if it\'s another shot of espresso, you gotta pay. But if it\'s other stuff, most of it\'s free. If you want an iced venti chai, light ice, try asking for 7-8 pumps of chai instead of 6. We\'re not allowed to just assume that\'s what you\'re going for (maybe some people do want a less strong flavor). If it\'s the caramel macchiato, maybe another shot and an extra pump of vanilla. \n\nI just feel like this happens a lot but people really don\'t understand the process and I just want people to be happy with their drinks.\n\nEdit for clarification: I\'m aware people get light/no ice for other reasons and I didn\'t mean to imply everyone\'s a cheapskate, but I think most baristas would err on the side of filling the cup. If you\'d rather not alter the recipe/flavor, feel free to let us know you\'d like light/no ice but you don\'t want anything added and you\'re okay with a little room in the cup. That should speed things up.','thedeadwillwalk','starbucks','2020-05-14','13:24:20'),('Something our customers would do',1729,'gich25','https://i.redd.it/uzzpp66yicy41.jpg',40,'2020-05-12 14:41:22',NULL,'handlesareokiguess','starbucks','2020-05-12','14:41:22'),('What it feels like making a latte after being closed for a month.',2145,'getw1r','https://v.redd.it/f7b2jfnky7x41',75,'2020-05-06 22:16:19',NULL,'brattyash','starbucks','2020-05-06','22:16:19'),('It’s not my first day back... it’s just my first day, period!
